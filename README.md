# StreamVault

StreamVault is a TV-first IPTV player for Android TV built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, Hilt, and Media3.

It is designed for large playlists, remote-friendly browsing, fast provider switching, and a polished living-room playback experience. StreamVault supports both `M3U` playlists and `Xtream Codes`, with dedicated flows for `Live TV`, `Movies`, and `Series`.

Built for Android TV first, StreamVault focuses on the things generic IPTV apps usually get wrong: D-pad navigation, quick channel movement, large-library organization, and a player that still feels good to use from the couch. Phone and tablet installs are also supported, but the primary UX target is TV.

## Highlights

- Android TV-first interface with D-pad-friendly focus, navigation, and playback flows
- Playlist support for `Xtream Codes` and `M3U` sources, including local playlist files
- Fast live-TV browsing with preview mode, favorites, recent channels, custom groups, and pinned categories
- Movie and series libraries with detailed info pages, resume support, episode switching, and auto-play for next episodes
- Full EPG support with guide search, XMLTV support, and provider archive or catch-up when available
- Multi-view split-screen playback for watching multiple channels at once
- Strong parental controls with PIN-protected categories and automatic adult-category detection
- TV integrations including Watch Next, launcher recommendations, TV input sync, and Cast support

- In Movies and Series, long-press categories or custom groups for hide or group-management actions where available.
- Long-press a live channel to queue it for Split Screen.
- Use the number keys on a remote while in the player to jump directly to a channel.
- While watching a series, open Episodes in the player to switch episodes without backing out to the details page.
