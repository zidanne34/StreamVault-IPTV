# StreamVault

StreamVault is a TV-first IPTV player for Android TV built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, Hilt, and Media3.

It is designed for large playlists, remote-friendly browsing, fast provider switching, and a polished living-room playback experience. StreamVault supports both `M3U` playlists and `Xtream Codes`, with dedicated flows for `Live TV`, `Movies`, and `Series`.

Built for Android TV first, StreamVault focuses on the things generic IPTV apps usually get wrong: D-pad navigation, quick channel movement, large-library organization, and a player that still feels good to use from the couch. Phone and tablet installs are also supported, but the primary UX target is TV.
