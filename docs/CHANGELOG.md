# Changelog

All notable product changes are recorded in this document.

## [1.0.14] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- DB migration from 1.0.12

### Fixed

- Login does nothing issue.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Added offline VOD download management with a Downloads screen, foreground service, grouped episode downloads, pause/resume/restart controls, and local playback for completed files.
- Added external playback mode and chooser handling so users can hand streams off to external player apps more reliably.
- Added a stream format selector to the player so users can switch formats when decoder recovery needs an alternate stream variant.
- Added a default landing screen setting so startup can open Home, Live TV, Movies, Series, Guide, Downloads, Plugins, or Settings instead of always opening Home.
- Added configurable colored remote button support for Android TV remotes, with global defaults plus playback and live-browse overrides for actions such as guide, channel info, favorites, category pinning, and split screen.
- Added QR-based provider pairing so users can scan from a phone on the same LAN, submit provider details locally, and add Xtream, Stalker, or M3U providers directly to the TV.
- Added a transparent live-TV full guide overlay that opens over player playback, reuses the EPG grid, supports category switching and search, and lets you tune channels directly from the overlay.
- Added a playback setting to let Split Screen/Multiview ignore provider max-connection limits when a provider allows multiple streams from the same IP.

### Changed

- Changed VOD downloads to use a single FIFO provider-stream scheduler with fresh provider URL resolution before each capture attempt.
- Changed provider playback/download coordination so provider-backed internal or external playback pauses active downloads, deletes partial output, and restarts from zero after playback ends.
- Changed the live player EPG flow so a second right-press can expand the channel EPG into the full transparent guide grid, with an on-screen directional cue and overlay-specific grid navigation.

### Fixed

- Attempted to fix Android TV backup export/import creating empty backup JSON or showing version `0` with `0` items on restore. Needs testing.
- Fixed the Settings crash report viewer so the latest crash content can scroll with the TV D-pad.
- Fixed provider delete confirmation staying open when a follow-up TV integration refresh failed after the provider had already been deleted.
- Fixed the bundled FFmpeg Media3 artifact so MPEG Layer II audio (`audio/mpeg-L2`) maps to the bundled `mp2` decoder and release builds pass FFmpeg verification again.
- Fixed a broken player content-resolution merge that could leave the app failing to compile.
- Fixed Xtream provider connection-limit parsing so placeholder values like `0`, empty, and `N/A` fall back safely instead of producing invalid limits.
- Fixed Xtream and Stalker onboarding/sync so VOD-only providers are not treated as failed when Live TV is empty, and Movies/Series loading still continues.
- Fixed player stream-info failures to preserve and surface the underlying error message instead of dropping it.
- Fixed decoder error recovery to retry against alternate stream formats when available.
- Fixed XMLTV parsing for ISO timestamps that include timezone offsets.
- Fixed EPG repository test setup so reactive time-shift lookups are stubbed correctly during build verification.
- Fixed completed local download playback so `content://`/`file://` files do not consume the provider download lease and do not pause active downloads.
- Fixed failed download Resume to clear partial output and restart through the scheduler.
- Fixed provider playback interruptions leaving downloads stuck in `DOWNLOADING` by cancelling the active OkHttp call and resetting the partial row to zero-byte `PAUSED` state.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Added live-first Stalker sync with background Movies/Series indexing so providers become usable sooner while VOD keeps loading in the background.
- Added advanced Stalker auth and MAG compatibility support, including MAC-only, credential-based, mixed auth, and stricter MAG identity presets.
- Added variant-aware Stalker playback handling for direct URLs, multi-command entries, temp-link portals, and `play/live.php` / `play/movie.php` backends.
- Added persisted Stalker portal learning for auth mode, portal profile, MAG preset, bootstrap recipe, endpoint preference, cookie mode, and last working playback path.
- Added a Stalker replay-fixture matrix and HAR-to-fixture capture script for onboarding new portal families faster.

### Changed

- Changed Stalker bootstrap from a single happy-path flow into recipe-driven session setup with cookies, localization/modules support, portal fingerprinting, and fallback rediscovery.
- Changed Stalker catalog parsing to preserve backend flags, command variants, archive/timeshift hints, and other portal capabilities for later playback decisions.
- Changed Stalker playback resolution to choose backend-specific strategies instead of forcing everything through one `cmd -> create_link` path.
- Changed Stalker sync recovery and manual sync to reuse indexed state, resume partial work, and avoid duplicate or blocking reloads.
- Changed Stalker EPG refresh to update more safely channel-by-channel instead of wiping healthy guide data up front.

### Fixed

- Fixed delete provider dialog, not closing after deletion.
- Fixed many Stalker portals that could browse catalogs but failed at playback because they needed different auth, bootstrap, cookie, endpoint, or temp-link behavior.
- Fixed incorrect handling of ambiguous Stalker account states such as `status=0`, which could previously be treated too aggressively as expired.
- Fixed Stalker temp-link and backend-family failures being reported too generically by surfacing clearer empty-link and session-rejection diagnostics, including HTTP `204` cases.
- Fixed Stalker indexing and hydration reliability on large or unstable portals with persisted cursors, retries, cooldowns, and safer stale-data pruning.
- Fixed Stalker setup and sync edge cases around wildcard categories, stale progress, provider diagnostics, explicit MAG identity overrides, and per-provider EPG counts.
- Fixed Stalker series detail season selection when some portals returned season-shell rows again for per-season requests, which could make multiple seasons show the same pseudo-episode list instead of that season's episodes.
- Fixed the Movies and Series Filter & Sort dialog layout so chip rows wrap cleanly instead of clipping or wasting space in the VOD modal.
- Fixed VOD category browse sort wiring so `Newest` and `Recently Updated` no longer collapse to the same behavior; Movies now separate release-date ordering from provider-added ordering, while Series keeps `Recently Updated` based on `last_modified` and uses release metadata for `Newest` when available across both Xtream and Stalker category views.
- Fixed top navbar unified search so mixed-case queries match live TV, movies, and series results case-insensitively.
- Fixed `TextureView` live preview and fullscreen playback turning solid green by correcting the player-view handoff path and stale frame retention during render-surface reuse.
- Fixed external XMLTV download URLs that return gzip-compressed MyEPG-style files without a `.gz` suffix so they refresh correctly instead of failing with stream reset or parse errors.
- fixed diagnostics window, size and scrolling capabilities.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Added close app icon, top right corner in settings tab.
- Added audio decoder names to player diagnostics.
- Added FFmpeg artifact verification plus provenance and LGPL docs.
- Hide Unhide individual channels.
- Added advanced playback settings for audio output and compatibility memory.
- Added richer FFmpeg and compatibility diagnostics.
- Added APK companion plugin discovery, activation, and provider integration.
- Added plugin installation from APK URLs and local files, plus auto-detection of compatible installed plugins.
- Added host-rendered plugin settings screens with persisted values, validation, and plugin actions.
- Added native Activity-based plugin configuration for richer plugin UIs.
- Added channel-name marquee on focused EPG rows and in the player info overlay, plus a persistent resolution badge on the overlay while channel info is visible.
- Added a welcome-screen `Set up later` option.
- Added Google Drive backup sync, onboarding import, and credential restore.
- Added Live TV quick-filter management for hidden categories and channels.
- Added opt-in debug onboarding seeding from `local.properties` with docs and template updates.
- Added real-time first-boot library sync progress on the welcome screen.

### Changed

- Refreshed the Plugins screen with denser StreamVault-styled controls and a dedicated icon.
- Expanded plugin API docs for manifests, installation, IPC, configuration, and UI integration.
- Clarified the Google Drive maintainer guide for `drive.appdata` and production rollout.

### Fixed

- Fixed unsupported audio playback by bundling Media3 FFmpeg decoders for `AC-3`, `E-AC-3`, `DTS`, `MP2`, and `TrueHD`.
- Fixed unsupported audio streams not retrying once in software when FFmpeg is available.
- Fixed explicit `TextureView` live playback getting stuck on green or corrupted frames before first video render.
- Fixed movie playback context and recovery so non-live titles no longer inherit stale live-channel state, external subtitle attachment resumes from the current position, and VOD retries preserve playback progress correctly.
- Fixed in-app updates crossing release channels: stable builds now only offer stable releases, beta builds now only offer beta prereleases, and same-version beta updates fall back to publish time to detect newer beta builds.
- Fixed software nav bars overlapping the app on devices like Nexus 5X.
- Fixed touch and mouse activation for TV plugin controls on non-TV devices.
- Fixed `TvClickableSurface` and `TvIconButton` long-press behavior for home-screen actions.
- Fixed missing favorite actions on series detail screens.
- Fixed Xtream series detail pages rendering empty when only metadata-only season payloads were returned.
- Fixed Xtream live sync category requests hanging near the end of large imports.
- Fixed Xtream live category-bulk partial sync dropping staged channels and leaving providers stuck on `Live 0`/inactive after successful live category imports.
- Fixed VOD category ordering to sort by provider-added time.
- Fixed Stalker VOD category filtering drifting when portal responses omitted category metadata.
- Fixed backup export and import to preserve hidden live categories and channels.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added Import Backup to startup provider setup, so new installs can restore saved providers from a backup instead of entering provider details manually.
- Added Android TV-friendly backup sharing and open-with import fallback for devices with limited file picker support.
- Added optional provider-level HTTP User-Agent and custom header overrides for Xtream and M3U providers.

### Changed
- Entire Xtream sync methodolgy was changed.

### Fixed

- Fixed long category names in Live TV and VOD classic view so focused rows marquee to reveal the full label, with RTL-aware direction for pure RTL names.
- Fixed movie and series fullscreen overlays taking too much screen space; VOD controls are now slimmer and quick actions stay on a single horizontal row instead of wrapping into a large second row.
- Fixed Live TV preview surface mode now matching fullscreen playback.
- Fixed fullscreen live playback now falling back from broken `TextureView` sessions to `SurfaceView`.
- Fixed player A/V sync state wiring in the fullscreen player UI.
- Fixed generic provider requests sometimes being sent without a User-Agent or consistent request identity. Xtream API, M3U playlist, and provider EPG requests now use a shared app-level User-Agent fallback with provider-scoped request profiles and sanitized request-header diagnostics; Stalker keeps its dedicated MAG-style identity path.
- Fixed favorites, recent live, and continue-watching provider scoping in all-providers mode.
- Fixed favorites persistence: partition-safe reorder, atomic move/merge, duplicate-safe global favorites, correct group counts.
- Fixed favorites screen empty-state so recent activity still appears when no favorites are saved.
- Fixed provider onboarding completing with a warning instead of failing when saved providers have a failed initial sync.
- Fixed Xtream and M3U onboarding validation: rejects embedded credentials, safe playlist-to-Xtream conversion, shared password validation.
- Fixed Xtream Live TV categories showing zero items when providers only send category membership in `category_ids`.
- Hardened playback session lifecycle for main, preview, and multiview engines; fixed stream renewal/catch-up/rewind losing headers, stale quality selections, and needless full re-prepares on metadata-only route updates.
- Fixed live playback decoder startup crashes and Auto-mode stutter by preferring hardware first with one software fallback.
- Fixed Fire OS / Android 9 playback-start crashes caused by unsupported SQLite UPSERT syntax in playback compatibility history persistence.
- Fixed default `AUTO` playback startup to use a safer stock Media3 path unless users explicitly enable AV sync or select a non-default decoder mode.
- Fixed automatic playback recovery to stay bounded and progressive instead of looping through aggressive startup-time workarounds.
- Fixed compatibility history so it is advisory only, non-fatal, and ignored during clean first startup.
- Fixed fatal playback failures now generating a release-safe crash report that users can view, share, and delete from Settings.
- Fixed several DVR lifecycle edge cases around recording promotion, foreground-service startup, handoff, and recovery.
- Fixed recording schedule backup/restore for padding, recurring rules, and partial import failures.
- Fixed reminder and recording scheduling: exact-alarm enforcement, stale suppression, alarm identity/cleanup, OS alarm cancel on provider delete.
- Fixed Android 13+ reminder and recording alert delivery by adding notification permission handling.
- Fixed backup import applying preferences before Room restore completed.
- Fixed movie and series filtered browse views returning drifted totals or broken paging.
- Fixed persistence guardrails: single active provider, cross-provider favorite group assignments rejected.
- Fixed Android TV app-shell re-entry for launcher and external navigation; rejected unsupported route payloads.
- Fixed Watch Next, launcher recommendations, and Live Channels staying aligned during provider switches and deletes.
- Fixed TV continue-watching and guide resilience: episode resume context preserved, Live Channels holds last-known-good rows during EPG gaps.
- Fixed search oversampling to 500 candidates before reranking so alphabetical SQL order no longer drops better matches.
- Fixed partial search failures showing as full empty state; sections now fail independently with a distinct "Search unavailable" notice.
- Fixed dashboard combined-profile VOD/health sourcing from a non-member provider.
- Fixed continue-watching in combined-profile mode now spanning all member providers.
- Fixed continue-watching and recommendations degrading silently to empty on transient IO failures; explicit degraded state shown instead.
- Fixed TV launcher recommendation channels being deleted on transient failures; channels preserved until a successful refresh confirms empty.
- Fixed TV launcher recommendations in combined-profile mode sourcing from a validated member, not the globally active provider.
- Fixed switching to a combined live profile not triggering a launcher recommendation refresh.
- Fixed provider delete requiring no confirmation; now requires explicit confirmation, is blocked while in-flight, and reports success/failure.
- Fixed active-provider switch writing preferences before the repository call succeeded.
- Fixed combined M3U profiles allowing activation with no enabled members and removal/disabling of the last enabled member while active.
- Fixed settings forms (combined M3U, EPG source add) dismissing before async operations complete; forms stay open with input intact on failure.
- Fixed backup import dialog allowing double-confirm in-flight and confirmation with all sections disabled; guard is now an atomic state transition.
- Fixed EPG source refresh only updating providers visible in the current settings session.
- Fixed EPG assignment observer jobs accumulating for deleted providers; cleaned up immediately on provider removal.
- Fixed recording storage settings (folder, pattern, retention, concurrency) racing on concurrent updates; writes serialized behind a mutex.
- Fixed privacy toggle rows firing twice from outer surface and inner Switch; Switch is now a passive indicator.
- Fixed internet speed test card allowing concurrent test runs.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-04-27

### Added

#### Player
- A/V sync offset controls — global and per-channel overrides; accessible from the channel info overlay (live) and player controls overlay (VOD).
- Compatibility Mode — improved decoder/surface fallback for stalled video playback.
- Video Surface selection — choose Auto, SurfaceView, or TextureView in Playback settings for device-specific rendering issues.
- Time format preference (System default, 12-hour, 24-hour) in Settings.
- Sleep timers — Stop Playback After and Allow Standby After Idle, with presets, countdowns, and warning overlays; defaults saved in Playback settings.
- Auto-Play Next Episode for series — 10-second **Up Next** countdown with Play Now and Cancel; toggle in Playback settings (on by default).

#### VOD
- Infinite scroll preference for Movies and Series — auto-load more rows and posters while browsing, or keep a manual Load More button.

### Fixed

- Fixed excessive live TV buffering from 1.0.8 — minimum buffer threshold reduced to 8 seconds (was effectively 30 seconds).
- Fixed inconsistent AM/PM and 24-hour timestamps — selected time format now applied consistently across Guide, Player overlays, Home, History, Dashboard, and Settings.
- Fixed EPG guide cutting off at 60 channels per category — additional channels now load automatically on scroll.
- Fixed a crash when opening Settings → EPG Sources on some devices by making the EPG source and provider list item keys unique.
- Fixed background EPG sync from stalling Live TV category loading after provider add.
- Fixed Stalker live sync loading large `get_all_channels` catalogs in a streaming, batched path to avoid out-of-memory crashes.
- Fixed Stalker live sync when portal category requests fail — the app now stages bulk live channels first and recovers fallback categories instead of leaving Live TV empty.
- Fixed Stalker native EPG fallback on portals that ignore per-channel `ch_id` requests and keep returning the full bulk guide — sync now detects the broken response shape and stops repeating the large download loop.
- Fixed modern VOD/series shelves to load on demand in smaller visible batches, with paged Stalker category loading and throttled Xtream category previews.
- Fixed Stalker series details using local numeric IDs instead of provider-native series IDs, which broke series info loading on portals that use composite IDs.
- Fixed Stalker series titles being overwritten by season-shell or numeric fallback names when detail payloads omitted the real title.
- Fixed shell-only Stalker series seasons to follow up with derived `season_id` requests and use explicit episode commands when the portal provides them.
- Fixed shell-based Stalker episode playback on stricter portals by passing the episode number into `create_link` instead of always using `series=0`.

---
## [1.0.8] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Added resume action on movie and series detail screens — shows formatted position and episode context (e.g. "Resume · S2 E3 · 23:45").

### Fixed

- Fixed Pro-mode Live TV preview to fullscreen handoff so live playback can continue more smoothly without media-session crashes.
- Fixed manual EPG add flow crashing instead of showing a proper error.
- Fixed M3U/M3U8 playlists using `#EXTGRP` loading all Live TV channels into one group.
- Fixed Stalker live sync over-requesting channels on provider add.
- Fixed Stalker EPG sync making redundant requests for duplicate or placeholder guide keys.
- Fixed Stalker background EPG sync skipping the bulk portal request and going straight to per-channel fetches.
- Fixed new Stalker providers defaulting to upfront EPG sync instead of background sync.
- Fixed Stalker playback on portals requiring MAG-style headers or fresh direct-URL resolution.
- Fixed Stalker probe failures and HTTP `456` errors being reported too generically.
- Fixed Xtream fast sync leaving movie and series categories temporarily empty.
- Fixed VOD browse pagination skipping items or leaving groups incomplete.
- Fixed VOD resume position, episode progress, and continue-watching state not updating reliably.
- Fixed silent audio when a stream's codec (e.g. EAC3, AC3) is unsupported — player now surfaces a clear error.
- Fixed Xtream Live TV taking a very long time to load on first sync with large providers (50k+ channels).

---

## [1.0.7] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Added Stalker Portal provider support.

### Fixed

- Fixed startup crashes on some Android 9 devices when secure preference storage fails to initialize.
- Fixed Picture-in-Picture setup on devices that report invalid or unsupported video aspect ratios.
- Fixed launch crashes for some upgrades from 1.0.4 or earlier caused by orphaned provider content left behind by older deletes.
- Fixed first-frame video freezes on some devices in fullscreen, live preview, and multiview playback.
- Fixed some playback failures not retrying after video had already started.

---

## [1.0.6] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- Fixed crash on upgrade from 1.0.4 to 1.0.5. The database migration FK integrity check (`PRAGMA foreign_key_check`) was running against the entire database instead of only the tables each migration modified. Users with any pre-existing orphaned rows (deleted provider history, stale EPG mappings, etc.) would hit an `IllegalStateException` and the app would crash on launch. Fresh installs were unaffected. The check is now scoped to the specific tables each migration writes to.

---

## [1.0.5] - 2026-04-16

### Added

#### Live Playback & DVR
- Added live rewind (timeshift) for live channels — up to 30 minutes buffer.
- Added timeline scrubber with live-edge indicator and seek controls.
- Added recording, catch-up, and restart controls directly in the player overlay.
- Added DASH stream support to the rewind engine.

#### Performance & Browsing
- Added incremental channel loading for large providers.
- Added incremental search results with automatic loading on scroll.
- Added automatic paging when reaching the end of the channel list.
- Added HTTP conditional requests (`ETag` / `If-Modified-Since`) to EPG refresh — unchanged feeds return `304 Not Modified` and skip download and parse entirely.
- Added EPG channel icon fallback — channels without a provider logo now use the icon from their matched EPG source.

#### System & Settings
- Added timeshift storage manager with automatic cleanup.
- Added auto-return on failed channels toggle.
- Added automatic update download option.
- Added options to show/hide “All Channels” and “Recent Channels”.
- Added "Hidden" option to Live TV Channel Numbering — hides channel numbers everywhere in the app (channel lists, player overlay, EPG, zap banner).
- Added live channel grouping settings with grouped/raw modes, grouped label style, and variant preference options.
- Added live channel variant selection in the player overlay, separate from adaptive stream quality selection.
#### Recording
- Schedule recordings directly from the EPG guide — Record, Record Daily, and Record Weekly buttons on any future program.
- Configurable pre/post recording padding (start early / end late) — applied automatically to all scheduled recordings.
- WiFi-only recording restriction — optionally prevent recordings from starting on mobile data.
- HLS recording quality cap — respects the per-network video quality preference instead of always picking the highest bandwidth variant.
- Recording conflict resolution dialog — shows which recordings overlap and offers to replace them instead of just showing an error.
- Recording status indicators on channel cards — REC and Scheduled badges on Dashboard and Search screens.
- Skip single occurrence of a recurring recording without cancelling the series.
- Search and filter in the recordings browser by title, channel, or status.
- Stalled-capture watchdog — recordings that stop receiving data for 60 seconds are automatically aborted.
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff on transient network failures during capture.
- Low disk space pre-flight check — scheduled recordings fail early with a clear message instead of writing partial files.
- Push notification on recording failure with channel name and reason.
- Completed recordings open in the player with resume position tracking.
#### VOD
- "Filter & Sort" button now shows active selections as a subtitle (e.g. "Favorites · Rating") and highlights with brand colour when non-default settings are applied — applies to both Movies and Series, modern and classic views.

#### Search
- Long-pressing a channel, movie, or series in Search now opens a context menu with Add/Remove Favorites, Hide, and Parental Lock/Unlock actions — consistent with the same actions available in other screens.

#### Parental Controls
- Added **PRIVATE** protection level — adult categories appear in the sidebar with a PIN lock, but are excluded from Search, EPG Guide, All Channels, and Recent so individual channel names (e.g. explicit titles) are never shown in mixed lists.
- PRIVATE is now the default protection level for new installs.
- Existing users with the old HIDDEN level are automatically migrated to the new HIDDEN (level 3); users previously on LOCKED remain on LOCKED.
- Protection level selection dialog upgraded to a title + description card layout matching other mode-selection dialogs.
- LOCKED level now correctly shows adult content in all views (EPG, Search, All Channels, Recent) — it previously blocked adult content from the EPG guide despite that not being the intended behaviour.

#### Database & Sync
- Search now indexes title, cast, director, and genre with BM25 relevance ranking — results are ordered by match quality.
- Program reminders — tap any guide entry to be notified before a show starts without scheduling a full recording.
- Watch progress and favorites are unified across providers for the same TMDB title — resume a movie on any provider from where you left off.
- Provider catalogs now enforce per-provider row limits to prevent malformed feeds from consuming device storage.
- EPG channel match quality is tracked per channel; channels with weak or missing EPG assignments surface in provider settings.
- Database diagnostics in Settings showing storage usage, per-table row counts, fragmentation level, and maintenance history.
- Background catalog and EPG sync jobs now survive process death and retry automatically on network recovery.
- Search history is now per content-type, timestamped, and stored in the database.
---

### Improved
- Faster loading and lower memory usage for large channel lists.
- More stable playback when switching channels.
- Live channel grouping now keeps raw provider rows intact and builds logical channels with explicit variants at read time.
- Live variant quality parsing now recognizes more tags, including `2K`, `576p`, `540p`, `fullhd`, `ultra hd`, and `uhd`.
- Live variant preference modes now support tag-first ranking and an observed-only mode based on actual playback telemetry.
- Channel grouping sub-options in Settings are visually nested under the main grouping control for clarity.
- Numeric channel entry now accepts up to 6 digits before resetting, which supports larger provider lineups.
- Better handling of live stream buffering and recovery.
- Improved recording settings layout with cleaner action grouping and a dedicated recordings browser dialog.
- Improved update UI feedback during downloads.
- EPG source delete now requires confirmation to prevent accidental removal.
- Refreshing an EPG source shows a per-source loading indicator instead of a global spinner, so multiple sources can refresh independently.
- Settings screen content scrolls up correctly when the keyboard opens, keeping text fields visible while typing.
- EPG feeds with non-UTF-8 encodings (ISO-8859-1/2, Windows-1252, etc.) now parse correctly — channel names and programme titles no longer appear garbled.
- EPG download read timeout increased from 30 s to 120 s for large or slow feeds.
- Catalog sync for large providers is significantly faster — field changes are diffed in Kotlin and applied in a single batched update instead of per-column correlated subqueries.
- EPG program data is now retained for the full catch-up window of each channel (up to 7 days) instead of a fixed 24-hour cutoff.
- EPG staging writes for large feeds are committed in a single transaction, cutting write time for 50 000-program feeds by roughly 10×.
- Series sync now skips unchanged series using server-provided last-modified timestamps, reducing API traffic on repeat refreshes.
- EPG and Xtream API responses are cached using server Cache-Control and ETag headers, eliminating redundant downloads on unchanged feeds.
- Channel and VOD browse lists now use keyset pagination — no items are skipped or duplicated during concurrent syncs and deep pages load faster.
- Movie and series watch-count sort no longer runs a subquery per row — watch count is stored on the content record.
- Playback progress is batched and flushed on a 30-second interval instead of writing to the database on every player tick.
- Partial sync no longer resets the provider refresh timer — only a complete successful sync marks a provider as up to date.

---

### Fixed

#### Playback
- Fixed incorrect channel info after auto-revert.
- Fixed repeated auto-revert causing channel switching loops.
- Fixed last-channel behavior after fallback.
- Fixed RTSP stream playback handling.
- Fixed MPEG-TS playback issues (black screen / corrupt frames).
- Fixed live buffer seeking returning incorrectly.
- Fixed player crashes on some devices.

#### Streaming & Stability
- Fixed stream detection for Xtream channels.
- Fixed DRM handling causing repeated retries.
- Fixed expired stream URLs during playback.
- Fixed heavy live-channel grouping work running too close to UI input paths by moving repository presentation transforms off the main thread.
- Fixed Xtream live recordings failing when provider direct-source URLs expired mid-recording.
- Fixed behind-live-window recovery issues.
- Fixed playback restarting due to EPG updates.

#### UI & Behavior
- Fixed update status stuck on “Downloading”.
- Fixed numeric channel input issues (0 handling).
- Fixed Picture-in-Picture activating incorrectly.
- Fixed missing channel handling after playlist refresh.
- Fixed active recording failures disappearing silently from the player without a notice.
- Fixed garbled average-speed placeholder text in recording details.
- Fixed favorites and custom groups being shared across unrelated providers. Combined M3U sources now merge member-provider favorites and groups in Home and Guide while saving changes back to the original provider.
- Fixed EPG category fallback logic.

#### EPG & Guide
- Fixed `.gz` EPG feeds being double-decompressed and failing to parse.
- Fixed blank URL accepted past the scheme validator when adding an EPG source.
- Fixed EPG list always appearing empty after a fresh install (list was never populated into the UI state).
- Fixed EPG sync rejecting plain HTTP URLs — M3U playlist header EPG (`x-tvg-url`), manual EPG sources, and M3U provider EPG fields now accept HTTP and HTTPS, matching the same policy already applied to Xtream providers.
- Fixed EPG search not escaping `%` and `_` wildcards, returning too many results on certain queries.
- Fixed "now & next" picking the wrong next program when programs had gaps.
- Fixed EPG channel-matching trimming whitespace inconsistently between ID index build and lookup.
- Fixed EPG source refresh not recording errors on failure, leaving stale "refreshing" status.
- Fixed EPG source refresh replacing live data non-atomically — writes now go to a staging area and swap in a single transaction.
- Fixed EPG override-candidates query loading all channels into memory instead of filtering in SQL.
- Fixed `MAX_EPG_SIZE_BYTES` duplicated across two repositories — now defined once in shared config.
- Fixed EPG source refresh not being rate-limited, allowing rapid repeated fetches.
- Fixed `jumpToDay` and `jumpToPrimeTime` using UTC epoch modulo instead of local-timezone arithmetic.
- Fixed guide timeline and program times using hardcoded 24-hour format instead of respecting the device locale.
- Fixed program progress bar gated on `isNowPlaying` flag instead of computing from timestamps.
- Fixed `EpgUiState` using `System.currentTimeMillis()` in default field values, causing inconsistent anchor times.
- Fixed guide search query not debounced, firing a database query on every keystroke.
- Fixed `nowTicker` flow restarting a new timer per collector instead of sharing a single upstream.

#### VOD
- Fixed "New to Old" sort not working for Movies. The `added` timestamp is now correctly used across the full pipeline, matching how series sorting works.

#### Provider Sync
- Fixed sync failing with "Login succeeded, but the initial sync failed" for live-only providers with no VOD or series content.
- Fixed providers with fast sync enabled showing **Partial** status incorrectly — providers now show **Active** when fast sync completes as intended.
- Fixed VOD-only providers (no live TV) failing on first sync when the server returns an empty live-streams response.

#### Database & Cache
- Fixed watch status not updating correctly after history was cleared — unwatched state is now read from the authoritative history table.
- Fixed stale data left behind when a provider was deleted while a sync was in progress.
- Fixed a background EPG job leaking a phantom reference when the job completed before it was registered.
- Fixed "now playing" showing an ended program on long-lived guide screens — current time is refreshed on each display tick.
- Fixed a forward clock jump suppressing cache refreshes beyond the corrected window.
- Fixed FTS search queries with unbalanced quotes or SQLite reserved operators causing crashes — malformed input is now sanitized before reaching the database.
- Fixed EPG provider mutex entries not being removed on provider deletion, leaking memory over long sessions.
- Fixed VACUUM maintenance running concurrently with an active sync, causing spurious sync failures.
- Fixed VACUUM pre-flight silently truncating the WAL file — replaced with a non-destructive passive checkpoint.
- Fixed favorites reordering issuing one database write per item — reordering now uses a single bulk update.
- Fixed category protection not being cleared when category IDs were remapped during a provider catalog restructure.
- Fixed sync session ID collisions after a clock correction — sessions now use random identifiers.
- Fixed database migrations that rebuild tables not verifying foreign key integrity before completing.
---
